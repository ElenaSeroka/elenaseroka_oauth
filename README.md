OAuth (Open Authorization) project

In this project I implemented a three-legged OAuth2 access delegation between a server-side rendered web application (the consumer) and GitLab (the service provider).
The project aimed to allow the user to log in on the consumer application using their gitlab.lnu.se account and show some basic profile information), including at least the 101 
most recent GitLab activities.
